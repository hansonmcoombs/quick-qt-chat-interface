# quick-qt-chat-interface
a Quick chat bubble interface written in PyQt6... because it seemed dumb that I couldn't steal one....

This was built from answers I found at:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40595060/bubble-chat-weight-in-python-and-pyqt
* https://forum.pythonguis.com/t/cloud-around-the-text-in-qtextedit/318/5
